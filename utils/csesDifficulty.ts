/**
 * CSES difficulty, derived from the whole problemset rather than per task.
 *
 * Why not the solve rate (solvedBy / attemptedBy)? CSES lets you resubmit
 * forever, and only people who already got through the earlier sections even
 * try the hard ones — so almost every task, "Weird Algorithm" and the
 * Advanced Techniques set alike, sits at a 75–95% solve rate. Bucketing on it
 * labelled nearly everything "easy".
 *
 * Instead, two signals that do track difficulty:
 *  1. The section. CSES sections follow the CPH book's progression, so each
 *     gets a curated band on a 0 (easy) .. 2 (hard) scale.
 *  2. Rank by solver count *within* that section. People work a section
 *     roughly top to bottom and drop off at the hard ones, so fewer solvers
 *     than its siblings means harder. Ranking inside the section (not
 *     comparing raw counts globally) keeps newer sections — which have fewer
 *     solvers only because they were added later — from all reading as hard.
 *
 * Output stays within easy/medium/hard, the buckets
 * scripts/refreshPlatformData.ts aggregates.
